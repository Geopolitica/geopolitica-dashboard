## Overview

The first step on a journey to predict the future of politics. This dashboard displays data gathered from the Data Collector in various forms to explore how to extract meaningful value from the texts' features.

Currently this is manifesting in the form of a clustering algorithm to group similar events together and track their progress quantitatively. More on that in future!
